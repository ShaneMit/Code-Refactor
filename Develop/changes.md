* Changes I made to the code:
* Updated title to "Horiseon"
* Changed footer from h2 to h4
* Added comments to clearly define elements
* Fixed SEO link so that it navigates to the proper part of the page
* Updated image class to match the name of the image (Digital-Marketing-Meeting)
* Added alt attributes to all images
* Organized CSS under comment that says what section of the page it affects
* Added HTML semantics
* Added reset.css
* The Nav bar went from horizontal to vertical after adding the reset.css. I could not figure out how to fix that.
