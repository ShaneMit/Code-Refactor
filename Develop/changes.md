Changes I made to the code:
1. Updated title to "Horiseon"
2. Changed footer from h2 to h4
3. Added comments to clearly define elements
4. Fixed SEO link so that it navigates to the proper part of the page
5. Updated image class to match the name of the image (Digital-Marketing-Meeting)
6. Added alt attributes to all images
7. Organized CSS under comment that says what section of the page it affects
8. Added HTML semantics
9. Added reset.css
10. The Nav bar went from horizontal to vertical after adding the reset.css. I could not figure out how to fix that.
